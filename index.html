    <h2 class="main-title">Donald Drapers story</h2>
    <main>
      
        <p>Donald Francis Draper, born Dick Whitman, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the AMC television series Mad Men (2007â€“2015), portrayed by Jon Hamm. Up to the Season 3 finale, Draper was creative director of fictional Manhattan advertising firm Sterling Cooper. He then became a founding partner at a new firm, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, after he and his superiors left their previous agency in advance of an unwanted acquisition. The agency later merged with a rival firm, Cutler Gleason & Chaough, to become Sterling Cooper & Partners while pursuing a contract from Chevrolet.

            The character of Don Draper is partially inspired by Draper Daniels, a creative director at Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago in the 1950s, who worked on the Marlboro Man campaign; and by Bill Backer, an advertising executive at McCann Erickson who created the "I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke" ad in 1971.</p>

        <p>The new Don Draper relocated to New York City, where he worked as a fur salesman and attended City College at night. With the support of his boss, he wrote advertising copy for the fur company, helping him build a portfolio along with some spec ads. At this job in 1953 Draper met his future wife, Elizabeth "Betty" Hofstadt (January Jones), a model who was photographed for one of his own ads. After a chance meeting at the store, he tricked a drunken Roger Sterling (John Slattery) into offering him a job at Sterling Cooper, where he eventually became Creative Director.

            He was considered a major asset to the company, as he had considerable talent for understanding the desires of others and for effectively pitching and selling ideas. Because of this, he was occasionally courted by other advertising firms. Although he kept his true character heavily guarded, almost everyone at the firm was portrayed as respecting his talent. At the same time, many in the firm were also troubled by Draper's erratic behavior.</p>
        
        <p>In December 1963, Draper convinced Bert Cooper (Robert Morse), Roger Sterling, and Lane Pryce (Jared Harris), along with Peggy Olson, Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), and Harry Crane (Rich Sommer), to leave Sterling Cooper rather than take their chances when they learn their parent company was to be purchased by rival firm, McCann Erickson. They formed a new agency, Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (SCDP), working out of a hotel suite before moving to the Time-Life Building. Draper also led a later merger with a rival agency. While the new agency (rebranded Sterling Cooper & Partners, SC&P) was successful, at the end of Season 6 he was forced to take "a leave of absence" from the new firm because of his erratic behavior, which cost the firm a possible advertising account with Hershey Chocolate.</p>
